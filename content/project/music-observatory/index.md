A `data observatory` is a permanent observation point for social and economic data. We have [reviewed](https://dataobservatory.eu/faq/observatories/) about 45 functioning and 15 failed observatories to assess how a fragmented and conflict of interest fraught industry like music could build an affordable, useful and high quality Music Observatory.

We do not want to build a data observatory alone, and we do not want to own this concept. On the contrary --- we want to be members of Consortium that can build an inclusive data observatory. We believe that the European Music Observatory should help ending the royalty gap between Northwestern and Southeastern Europe, should be inclusive, and equip the European music industry with large enough data to make the promise of closing the value gap a reality.

The European Music Observatory should be open for collaborations with representative [international music organizations](#internationalparnter), [representative national organizations](#nationalpartner),  [city-, regional- or provincial organizations](#subnationalpartner), and [business and scientific research organizations](#businesspartners), and, because the music industry is largely made up from creative freelancer networks and [microenterprises, even individual researchers](#smallpartners) (to a limited extent). We believe that it should be able to demonstrate direct value for [individual artists, technicians and managers](#musicianpartner), too. We want to make this demonstration together with stakeholders from these segments.

Data is power, and `big data creates injustice`.  Organizations that control large amounts of data, for example, the entire listening history of hundreds of millions of people in all major countries of the world, can train algorithms and robots that drive most of the music in the world.  They can make your investment into a sound recording successful or doomed. They can circumvent or help a local content regulation, reinforce, or disable a national cultural policy goal.  We want to make sure that our way of data integration is democratic, inclusive and transparent, and will not re-inforce, but reduce inequalities within Western and Eastern Europe, Northern and Southern Europe, between independent and major labels. 

`We want big data to work for small venues, independent labels, startups, great and undiscovered artists.` We believe that you cannot make a successful album launch, a market entry or introduce a successful cultural policy without large amounts of well processed and correctly analysed data. We want to create an observatory that integrates the small data of many small bands, small labels, small venues, small countries, and mount correct the injustice. Make algorithms transparent and the competition fair.

Our `Demo Music Observatory` [was launched](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/) in September 2020 and got into the presitgious [Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/). Our demo observatory is an example how we believe the European Data Observatory should be built. An observatory is a permanent observation point for social and economic data. We want to prove that this process can be made cost-effectively and efficiently, providing a high-quality, valuable and timely product by employing best practices in research automation and open source software, using open data in open collaboration with the music industry, artists, technicians and managers.

## Quality, Transparency & Technical Requirements 

- [x] The `European Music Observatory` should fully exploit the EU's **open data** regime. (See our examples: [our first open data release](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-16-regional-opendata-release/))
- [x] It should be transparent, the indicator design should be based on open-source statistical software.
- [x] The European Music Observatory must embrace evidence-based [open Policy Analysis](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/approach.html#opa)
- [x] The observatory must allow a seamless [data integration](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/approach.html#dataintegration) between open data, and highly confidential proprietary data.
- [x] The open collaboration principle must allow an easy opt-in and opt-out for small and larger, public and private organizations, and offer for full transparency for all users.
- [ ] It should not re-collect data that already exists. Instead it should create policies, synergies and incentives that bring that data to light.
