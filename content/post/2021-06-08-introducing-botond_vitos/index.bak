Coming from a cultural studies background, my main research interest has been grassroots music scenes and festival cultures, which I hope to extend to my current projects as data engineer and a data scientist as well. My prior research was mainly qualitative in scope, focused on the insider views and stories of scene participants and stakeholders, which often proves invaluable in the understanding of such specialized stylistic vocabularies. At the same time I am interested in the “bigger picture” as well, which can be approximated through algorithmic approaches and data analysis. So this is how I drifted towards data science and engineering.
