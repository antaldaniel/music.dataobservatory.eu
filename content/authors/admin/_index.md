We are developing our [Demo Music Observatory](project/music-observatory/) in the world's 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the [Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab](post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/) following the structure laid out in the [Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory](post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/). 

**The Demo Music Observatory Pillars**: 

1. [Music Economy](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-economy.html)
2. [Diversity & Circulation](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-diversity.html)
3. [Music & Society](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-society.html)
4. [Innovation - innovative data applications](projects.html)

We believe that the many of the "missing data" in the _Feasibility Study_ is illusory. `Challenge us`: we may find it for you, and place it among the weekly updated, `freely downloadable`, fully documented indicators. 

Our aim is to show that a better data map, a better organizational model, examples of research automation and other data integration innovation that can reduce the budgetary needs of the European Music Observatory by 80-90% and provide far more timely, accurate, and relevant service than most data observatories in Europe.
