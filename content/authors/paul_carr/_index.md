Hi Paul, 

As  I promised, I am going to re-organize the Music Observatory website, moving the data tables and the too much text to subdomains, and keeping the focuson on research material. I am far from finished, I will add a lot more from various countries, but this is roughly how it will look.

https://zealous-jennings-bc852b.netlify.app/    [this is a temporary, hard to find address for testing and building]
Your new publication will be the top featured:
https://zealous-jennings-bc852b.netlify.app/#featured

The old one will be in the archives:
https://zealous-jennings-bc852b.netlify.app/publication/welsh_live_music_industry_2011/

Can you please fill out your details and give an at least 400x400 photo, so that your author profile will be similar to Andrés's https://zealous-jennings-bc852b.netlify.app/author/andres-garcia-molina-phd/ , I filled out some of your data based on your LinkedIn, but it would be nice if you'd add a few lines.

It will pop up here: https://zealous-jennings-bc852b.netlify.app/#team  
and when somebody clicks your name on the reports. [I took a photo from the Welsh Assembly video]
and look like this roughtly https://zealous-jennings-bc852b.netlify.app/author/dr-paul-carr/

Please review and correct your data as applicable below

Best regards, 
Daniel
